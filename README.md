IMPLEMENTATION OF <br/>PATHFINDING ALGORITHMS<br/> (in Java, C, Javascript, C++)
======================================================================

Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains implementations of some basic Pathfinding algorithms
using languages Java, C, Javascript and C++. Pathfinding algorithms are used in the
field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in gaming design. In this repository,
3 basic algorithms have been implemented: [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), 
[Depth-First Search (DFS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) and 
[A* Search algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm). The implementations using C, C++
and Java contain only A* algorithm. The Javascript implementations contain all 3 algorithms and a live [DEMO](http://dimosr.github.io/Pathfinding) has been implemented, where all algorithms can be executed in a browser. The algorithms can also be compared in this DEMO.

Implementations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The folder [*'C'*](https://github.com/dimosr7/Pathfinding/tree/master/C), contains the implementation for A* in C.
* The folder [*'Java'*](https://github.com/dimosr7/Pathfinding/tree/master/Java), contains the implementation for A* in Java.
* The folder [*'Javascript'*](https://github.com/dimosr7/Pathfinding/tree/master/Javascript), contains the implementation for A*,BFS and DFS in Javascript, as well as the Demo web implementation.
* The folder [*'C++'*](https://github.com/dimosr7/Pathfinding/tree/master/C++), contains the implementation for A* in C++.
